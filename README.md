# KweliNet

**KweliNet** is Kenya's political finance transparency platform — an open-intelligence data explorer that tracks disclosed private donations to political parties, maps political actors, surfaces verified campaign violations, and contextualises the regulatory framework governing money in Kenyan politics.

> _"Kweli"_ is Swahili for _truth_. KweliNet is built on the premise that transparency is the foundation of healthy democracy.

## Overview

KweliNet aggregates data from public regulatory sources — primarily the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties (ORPP) — and presents it through interactive, analyst-grade visualisations. The platform is designed for journalists, civil society organisations, researchers, and engaged citizens who want to follow the money in Kenyan politics.

## Data Sources

KweliNet currently ships with mock data closely modelled on real ORPP disclosure reports, IDEA political finance database entries, and publicly available tribunal records. Live data ingestion pipelines are in development.

- **Financial Flow data** — based on ORPP published declaration report (last updated: 28 November 2025)
- **Regulatory data** — sourced from [International IDEA Political Finance Database](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/political-finance-database), updated with Kenyan gazette notices and tribunal rulings
- **Contact / tips** — `investigations@kwelinet.or.ke`

## Disclaimer

All data presented is sourced from public regulatory filings and verified whistleblower submissions. KweliNet does not publish unverified claims. The platform explicitly excludes statutory public transfers (Political Parties Fund disbursements), informal harambee networks, and donations below the KES 1M disclosure threshold — these limitations are clearly communicated within the application.
